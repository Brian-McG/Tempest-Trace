### Overview
Tempest Trace is a competitive player-versus-player first-person running game whereby the player competes against the clock and against another player to get from the start to the end of a parkour/free running track while trying to keep their movements smooth and free flowing. 

The player is tasked with traversing an obstacle course in as short a time as possible while avoiding drones and snipers who would try to slow down or eliminate the player.

Apply your strategic mind to the selection of the optimal route through the obstacle course. Has your opponent tried to take a shortcut? Respond by punishing them for their greed!

You have a limited supply of tactical gadgets such as smoke bombs to throw off your opponents and gain the advantage. But use them wisely as you never know when you might need it later.
